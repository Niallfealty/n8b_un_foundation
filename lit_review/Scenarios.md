# Scenarios

TMP_NOTE: this file to be completed during analysis of data (the comparison should be a combination of qualitative and quantitative), for now this just lays out the scenarios we consider.

## Overview

This document reviews how scenarios fit into the analysis and how we view them.

We outline which scenarios to consider and how these fit into the key forecasts and their analysis, fitting these aims into our interpretation of models and scenarios.

## Scenario descriptions

These are the scenarios we consider:

1. Things improve - population growth is reduced and severe impacts are lessened (sublinear increase or reductions in impact). Outcome is lower population with better prospects.
2. Business as Usual - continuation along roughly the same trajectory (looks somewhat like an extrapolation of current trends/linear(?) trend). Important to understand likely specific impacts and what things look like for population.
3. Things deteriorate - population growth impacts increase over time (superlinear trend, more severe than continuation of trend). Outcomes are larger population with worse prospects.
4. Catastrophic failure - very large growth (e.g. exponential, at least in specific locales) and significant impacts from this (e.g. knock-on climate impacts). Outcomes are severe impact for both population and climate/environment, potential population collapse as consequence. Note comments on population as a climate driver in [latest IPCC synthesis report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_SYR_LongerReport.pdf)

## Measured against scenarios in key projections

### UNPD projection

#### Scenarios

- High, Medium, Low fertility; based on fertility scenarios, see text below (instant-replacement and constant fertility included for completeness)
```
Five of those scenarios differ only with respect to the level of fertility, that is, they share the same assumptions made with respect to sex ratio at birth, mortality and international migration. The five fertility scenarios are: low, medium, high, constant-fertility and instant-replacement-fertility. A comparison of the results from these five scenarios allows an assessment of the effects that different fertility assumptions have on other demographic parameters. The high, low, constant-fertility and instant-replacement scenarios differ from the medium scenario only in the projected level of total fertility. In the high scenario, total fertility is projected to reach a fertility level that is 0.5 births above the total fertility in the medium scenario. In the low scenario, total fertility is projected to remain 0.5 births below the total fertility in the medium scenario. In the constant-fertility scenario, total fertility remains constant at the level estimated for 2022. In the instant-replacement scenario, fertility for each country is set to the level necessary to ensure a net reproduction rate of 1.0 starting in 2022. Fertility varies slightly over the projection period in such a way that the net reproduction rate always remains equal to one, thus ensuring the replacement of the population over the long run.

### Lancet/GBD

- Reference
- SGD met need

The Global Burden of Disease model (GBD) had two scenarios we considered - a reference scenario which used [mortality from this paper](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(18)31694-5/fulltext)


### Earth4All

- Too little too late (TLTL)
- Giant Leap (GL)

These scenarios are based on sets of policy assumptions, [detailed in p38-49 of this paper (v1)](https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/5111/). The headline description of the scenarios are: TLTL - decision making as usual; GL - testing policy run for well-being



## Studies looking at recent trends/pattern shifts

This section (which may be moved somewhere else as fits the general structure) documents studies on changes in trend or understanding whether or not there has been a shift in trend.

- [This **preprint** from the Wittgenstein centre and Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mvy62) looks at a potential fertility shock from Covid 19 (n.b. a preprint and suggests a shock imact rather than paradigm shift)
- [this JAMA study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34081139/) gives context and suggests that while there may be (U.S. local) agreement this appears to be a blip and later surge can be expected
