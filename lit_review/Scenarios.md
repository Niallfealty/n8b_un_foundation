# Scenarios

## Overview

This document reviews how scenarios fit into the analysis and how we view them.

We outline which scenarios to consider and how these fit into the key forecasts and their analysis, fitting these aims into our interpretation of models and scenarios.

## Scenario descriptions

These are the scenarios we consider:

1. Things improve - population growth is reduced and severe impacts are lessened (sublinear increase or reductions in impact). Outcome is lower population with better prospects.
2. Business as Usual - continuation along roughly the same trajectory (looks somewhat like an extrapolation of current trends/linear(?) trend). Important to understand likely specific impacts and what things look like for population.
3. Things deteriorate - population growth impacts increase over time (superlinear trend, more severe than continuation of trend). Outcomes are larger population with worse prospects.
4. Catastrophic failure - very large growth (e.g. exponential, at least in specific locales) and significant impacts from this (e.g. knock-on climate impacts). Outcomes are severe impact for both population and climate/environment, potential population collapse as consequence.
