# Scenarios

TMP_NOTE: this file to be completed during analysis of data (the comparison should be a combination of qualitative and quantitative), for now this just lays out the scenarios we consider.

## Overview

This document reviews how scenarios fit into the analysis and how we view them.

We outline which scenarios to consider and how these fit into the key forecasts and their analysis, fitting these aims into our interpretation of models and scenarios.

## Scenario descriptions

These are the scenarios we consider:

1. Things improve - population growth is reduced and severe impacts are lessened (sublinear increase or reductions in impact). Outcome is lower population with better prospects.
2. Business as Usual - continuation along roughly the same trajectory (looks somewhat like an extrapolation of current trends/linear(?) trend). Important to understand likely specific impacts and what things look like for population.
3. Things deteriorate - population growth impacts increase over time (superlinear trend, more severe than continuation of trend). Outcomes are larger population with worse prospects.
4. Catastrophic failure - very large growth (e.g. exponential, at least in specific locales) and significant impacts from this (e.g. knock-on climate impacts). Outcomes are severe impact for both population and climate/environment, potential population collapse as consequence. Note comments on population as a climate driver in [latest IPCC synthesis report](https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/syr/downloads/report/IPCC_AR6_SYR_LongerReport.pdf)

## Studies looking at recent trends/pattern shifts

This section (which may be moved somewhere else as fits the general structure) documents studies on changes in trend or understanding whether or not there has been a shift in trend.

- [This **preprint** from the Wittgenstein centre and Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mvy62) looks at a potential fertility shock from Covid 19 (n.b. a preprint and suggests a shock imact rather than paradigm shift)
- [this JAMA study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34081139/) gives context and suggests that while there may be (U.S. local) agreement this appears to be a blip and later surge can be expected
