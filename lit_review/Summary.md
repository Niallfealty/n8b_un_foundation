# Summary document for literature review

N.B. Subject to being used as a scratchpad during lit review, to be whittled down and split out into more modular notes later.

## Key sources/forecasts

### Forecasts and sources

* [UN - Department of Economic and Social Affairs: Population Division](https://population.un.org/wpp/) - key for this study
* [Wittgenstein Centre (IIASA)](https://www.wittgensteincentre.org/en/index.htm)
* [Global Burden of Disease Study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(20)30677-2/fulltext) ([main link is pop forecast paper - this is project site](https://www.thelancet.com/gbd))
* [DemographEye](https://worlddata.io/agespot-demographic-forecasts/) (looks like a local planning-specific tool but included on first pass as an attempt at completeness) - no obvious papers on methodology
* [Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation](https://www.healthdata.org/data-visualization/population-forecasting) - appears to be tied to Global Burden of Disease Study (project part of institute perhaps? Further reading needed)
* [World Bank](https://databank.worldbank.org/source/population-estimates-and-projections) So far [this is the closest thing to a methodology I've found](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/articles/843507-what-are-the-methodologies-used-in-estimating-the) but that looks like either there isn't any significant forecast or it's as simple as a linear regression against recent data (I think)

These are the key ones I've found so far (will add any further to abive list).
